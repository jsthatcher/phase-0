What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Delivery, Maintenance

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
The goal of my site is to create a professional space online for protential employers to learn about me and the work that I have done. I'll include an About Me page, my resume, a selection of projects, maybe a link to my blog, and a contact me page.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
Because I want employers in the tech industry to be the main users of the site, it will need to be crisp and professional. The website should be as good of a representation of my skill as any of the projects I include.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The Primary action I'd like the user to have is for them to look at my projects. I want the website intrigue them enough to look at the other work I've done. Once they see how awesome I am I'd want their next action to be looking at my resume to see WHY I'm so awesome.'

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
It's important to think about the movement of the website. You want to plan where the users eyes will be drawn to first and where they will want to go first.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experience design is a style of design where they specificly try to make the user as comfortable as possible while they utilize the website. The designers want to create an experience that the user want to repeat.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Creating the site map was probably most tedious, but that only because I tried to use gimp for the first time to make it. But, I gave up and got a trial for an online app DBC recomended
