<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It felt good to recognize the tags and atributes that I needed to add

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Good. I love how many resources there are to consult. Maybe too many! There are so many different ways people find to solve problems.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
Halfway through we decided to use indentation. It's so hard to see what's going on without it!

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
I like that there are tags simply for navigational purposes like nav, and footer and simply tell you where you are in the page. It helps me stay organized.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Keep a cheatsheet with you until you don't need it!
