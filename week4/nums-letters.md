What does puts do?
Puts prints the output to the console on a new line. It returns nothing

What is an integer? What is a float?
Integers are whole numbers whereas floats can keep track of decimal values. Both can be positive and negative.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
While using division with floats you can get exact answers down to the decimal place. Because integers can only be whole numbers, when dividing Ruby truncates the remainder. For example 9/2 = 4 (with a truncated remainder of 1) while 9.0/2.0 = 4.5

My Code:
```
puts "Hours in a year: #{365 * 24}"

puts "Minutes in a decade: #{10 * 365 * 24 * 60}"
```

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

What is the difference between integers and floats?
Integers are only whole numbers while floats can have fractional values.

What is the difference between integer and float division?
Float division is most accurate, while integer division truncates the remainder. However you can always use the modulus operator to find this.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings are sets of characters. Usually they are used to hold samples of text.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
A local variable is a variable that you create yourself and is local to whatever subroutine you are in. These would be used within a single method or function. A global variable is accessable throughout the entire file. 

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
Yes! A good review from what we learned before the interview
