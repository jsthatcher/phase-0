What is a one-to-one database?
When working with a one-to-one database the parent record will have a single child. The best example of this is that I could find is that everyone person on has one passport.

When would you use a one-to-one database?
A one-to-one database can only be used when you know that there will be one record for each parent element.

What is a many-to-many database?
A many-to-many database is much easier to conceptualize. These databases allow the parent records to call any child record that it wants, no matter if it has been used before.

When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
Many-to-many databases can we used when there isn't a one to one relationship between the variables.'

What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
I think I'm a little rusty on working with one-to-one databases, but I'm sure it will come with time.
