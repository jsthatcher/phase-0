How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
Being able to see you changes in real time, make a huge different while troubleshooting problems.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
width and height selectors
What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Static is default. Relative means that the changes you make the objects will be from it's origional place. Absoulute means you may place the object wherever you want on the page. Fixed means it is stuck to the side of the the browser window. Fixed and absoulute were the easiest to use whereas relative positioing requires you to think through a couple more steps.'

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
The margin is the empty space around the object. The border immidiately surrounds the objects and padding is inside the object around any text, image or link that is there.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I liked it! My parter and I wizzed right on through it.
