/*
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
The type of file, the path to the file and it's relationship to the HTML file

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
There were a couple difficult spots, but with enough fiddling around we got them to work. Usually we just needed to add another division, or a couple times changing the height of the line solved our problem.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
We used color, font size, borders, margin, a couple pusudo-class selectors for the links and a couple more.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
We tried to use as many classes and ID's as possible so we could stay organized. Naming them ourselves really made that easy. When working on the spacing between links it didn't make sense to add a class to each link, so instead we used div div a{} as the selector.
 
When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
I think ours is cleaner because we used CSS.
