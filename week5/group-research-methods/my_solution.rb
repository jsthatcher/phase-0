# # Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.

# # I used .include?() method which returns true if the passed argument exists in the variable that .include?() was called on.
# Example: name = "Andrey"   name.include?("d")  => true
# # I also used << which basically just appends(adds) something to the end of an array.

# # Release 3: Reflect!
# # What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
