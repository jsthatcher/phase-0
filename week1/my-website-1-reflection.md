Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Creating a repository on GitHub is pretty straight forward. In the top right of the screen you have the option to create a new repository. Once you choose to, you can name it, choose its privacy settings, and choose to include a README or License. Cloning is a little more difficult. Github will give you a URL for your repo. In your command line you navigate to the directory you want to place your clone in. Use the command git clone <URL>. You now have this file locally and remotely.

Describe what open source means.
This means that the original code is availible to be used by whoever wishs.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Both! I love the idea of people freely releasing their ideas to the world without thinking about money or power. I'd like to think that I'd do the same, but I could see why some people would be nervous. Making a project you've spent years of your life on open source might feel like you're giving away your time and money. I'm sure my perspective on this will change as I continue learning.


Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses allow you to decide how your work may be used by others. If you don't want to release your work open source but still want it to be shared or modified in some way a licensee is a good way of controling how your property is used.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Honestly the Git Workflow solidified for me in this section. I should have mastered it last section, but doing it one final time made me much more confident in my abilities. 

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
